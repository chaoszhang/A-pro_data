* `astral-c12-renamed-induced-figtree.tre`: ASTRAL tree from original pub with extra leaves removed
* `single-copy-astral-localPP-recomputed-originalformula-newformula.tre`: The ASTRAL tree from original pub with support values computed from genes with extra leaves removed. Support is computed using ASTRAL original localPP formula and A-Pro formula and are shown in that order.

* A-Pro tree on C12 gene trees.

Used for renaming stuff:
