================== ASTRAL-Pro ===================== 

This is ASTRAL-Pro (A-Pro) version 1.1.2
Using native AVX batch computing.
Gene trees are treated as unrooted
There are 4 threads used to run.
The number of input tree read is 7180
92752 trees read from pep.ml.renamed.trees
8190 extra trees.
All output trees will be *arbitrarily* rooted at scer
